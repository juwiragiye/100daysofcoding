### Day one HTML basics

HTML is Hpyertext Markup Language used to describe structure and content of web page.

HTML elements consist: table, paragraph, link, video, image, etc...

An Element has an opening tag `<>` and closing tag `</>` and may or not have content. Depends!

A page should always start from the index.html file. It's optional but recommended.

Basic Structure is html->head-body<-html

#### Headings:

They are 6 headings in html. h1 to h6.
h1 being the biggest and h6 being the smallest.
